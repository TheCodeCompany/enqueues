# Webpack vs @wordpress/scripts Comparison

## Overview

This document compares the Enqueues webpack automation system with WordPress's official `@wordpress/scripts` tooling. Understanding these differences helps you choose the right approach for your project's needs and complexity.

## What Is @wordpress/scripts?

`@wordpress/scripts` is WordPress's official build tool for block development. It provides a standardized way to build blocks with minimal configuration.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Single `block.json` file as entry point
- Automatic dependency extraction for `@wordpress/*` packages
- Built-in webpack configuration optimized for blocks
- Outputs to `build/` directory by default
- Designed for individual block development

## What Is Enqueues Webpack Automation?

The Enqueues webpack automation provides advanced asset management with automatic discovery, conditional loading, and seamless PHP integration.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Multiple `block.json` files across organized directories
- Automatic discovery of blocks, plugins, and extensions
- Custom webpack configuration with Enqueues integration
- Context-aware asset loading based on content analysis
- Outputs to organized `dist/block-editor/` structure

## When to Use Each Approach

### **Choose @wordpress/scripts When:**

- **Simple Block Development**: Building individual blocks with minimal customization
- **WordPress Standards**: Preferring official WordPress tooling and conventions
- **Small Teams**: Limited WordPress development experience
- **Quick Prototyping**: Need to get blocks working quickly
- **Maintenance Concerns**: Want WordPress team to handle updates and maintenance
- **Simple Projects**: Basic themes with few custom blocks

**Example Use Case:**
```json
// Simple block.json for @wordpress/scripts
{
  "name": "my-plugin/my-block",
  "editorScript": "file:./index.js",
  "editorStyle": "file:./index.css",
  "viewStyle": "file:./style-index.css"
}
```

### **Choose Enqueues Webpack When:**

- **Complex Theme Development**: Large themes with many blocks and page types
- **Performance Critical**: Need optimized asset loading and conditional loading
- **Advanced Features**: Require inline assets, caching, or custom optimization
- **Scalability**: Building systems that need to scale with many blocks
- **Integration**: Want seamless PHP/JavaScript asset management integration
- **Custom Workflows**: Need advanced build automation and asset discovery

**Example Use Case:**
```javascript
// Advanced webpack config with Enqueues
const entries = enqueuesMergeWebpackEntries(
  {
    // Manual theme entries
    'main': ['./source/js/scripts.js'],
    'search': ['./source/js/search-app/index.js'],
  },
  // Automatic theme asset discovery
  enqueuesWebpackEntries(rootDir, path, glob),
  // Automatic block editor discovery
  enqueuesBlockEditorWebpackEntries(rootDir, path, glob, 'source/block-editor')
);
```

## Migration Strategies

### **From @wordpress/scripts to Enqueues Webpack**

1. **Phase 1: Setup**
   ```bash
   # Install Enqueues dependencies
   composer require thecodeco/enqueues:dev-main
   ```

2. **Phase 2: Restructure**
   ```
   src/
   ├── block.json          # Move to source/block-editor/blocks/my-block/
   ├── index.js
   ├── style.scss
   └── render.php
   ```

3. **Phase 3: Configure**
   ```javascript
   // webpack.config.babel.js
   import enqueuesBlockEditorWebpackEntries from 'path/to/enqueues';
   
   const entries = enqueuesBlockEditorWebpackEntries(rootDir, path, glob);
   ```

4. **Phase 4: Update Scripts**
   ```json
   {
     "scripts": {
       "dev": "webpack --watch",
       "build": "webpack --mode=production"
     }
   }
   ```

### **From Enqueues Webpack to @wordpress/scripts**

1. **Phase 1: Consolidate**
   - Move all blocks to single `src/` directory
   - Create single `block.json` file

2. **Phase 2: Simplify**
   - Remove custom webpack configuration
   - Use standard `@wordpress/scripts` commands

3. **Phase 3: Manual Enqueuing**
   - Implement manual asset enqueuing system
   - Remove Enqueues PHP integration
